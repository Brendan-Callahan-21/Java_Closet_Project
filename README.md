    The program runs through a seven day cycle. Each day it asks what the tempurature is, and what activities you 
plan on doing and gives you a list to choose from. then for each activity in the day it compiles a list of 
clothing items making up an outfit. 
    Each outfit falls under the category of what you are doing and what the tempurature is. it also will make 
sure the color of clothes match. For example the program will not assign two clothing items to the same outfit 
if they each are two bright and very different colors. Instead it will look for one main color and match it 
with darker or less signifigant colors like black grey white and tan.
    All clothing items are stored in .csv files with boolean attributes that correspond to things like cold/warm
weather, gym, school, ect. There is also an attribute for clean/dirty items, and an item will get switched to 
dirty every time it is worn. Then at the end of the 7 day cycle, the laundry is done and all dirty clothes
become clean.
